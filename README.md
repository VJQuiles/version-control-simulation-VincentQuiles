# Reflection

To begin, I created a remote repository in github. I then cloned it to my computer. From there i created a blank html page and inserted boiler plate html. From there, i created a feature/header branch, and added an h1 element into the body. I added the header the right way at the end of the project. I then checked back to main, restoring the boilerplate html. From there i created a feature/footer branch, and created a footer in the same lines of code as the header in the other feature branch, queing up the merge conflict. From there i checked back to main, and merged the footer in. I then merged in header, and created the merge conflict. To resolve, i placed the header and footer in their appropiate locations, and then added and commited those changes. I then pushed the code from my computer, to the remote repo. As i stated earlier, i did not put the appropiate header attribute, so i went and added that commited it. I then went and created a review/main branch, and pushed that into the repo. From there i selected compare and pull request from github, and selected main as the base branch, and review/main as the compare branch. For extra practice, i also merged in the file. 

Pull requests help ensure code quality and collaboration because of the fact that it requires getting peers involved to review code(collaboration) and fix any potential bugs(code quality).
